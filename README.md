# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### In this challenge we work for a large company, Pewlett Hackard, that has been around for a long time. Pewlett Hackard is preparing for the "silver tsunami", where their baby boomer employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate. We have been tasked with identifying the employees who are set to retire soon, as well as determine the employees who are eiligible for a "mentorship program" (a program in which employees who are set to retire soon will only work part-time and mentor PH employees). We have been given 6 different CSV datasets which we will use to pull the requested data through a series of SQL joins and calculations.

## Results

### After joining several tables, filtering for the data we want, and performing a few calculations, we arrive at the two tables below:

### The first list is the amount of employees, by title, at Pewlett Hackard that are preparing to retire soon. After looking at the table we can conclude a few things:

### - Pewlett Hackard has a massive retirement problem. They have 90,398 employees who are set to retire soon, which is a staggering number. If they didn't know the silver tsunami poses a great threat to the company, this analysis will make them aware.

### - Pewlett Hackard should probably prioritize on replacing the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff positions. These two titles combined make up 64% of the overall retiring employees dataset.
