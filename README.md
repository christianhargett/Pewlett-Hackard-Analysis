# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### In this challenge we work for a large company, Pewlett Hackard, that has been around for a long time. Pewlett Hackard is preparing for the "silver tsunami", where their baby boomer employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate. We have been tasked with identifying the employees who are set to retire soon, as well as determine the employees who are eiligible for a "mentorship program" (a program in which employees who are set to retire soon will only work part-time and mentor PH employees). We have been given 6 different CSV datasets which we will use to pull the requested data through a series of SQL joins and calculations.
